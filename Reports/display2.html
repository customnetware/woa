The resident learned of this after she had assisted an individual who was having trouble.   I checked the exit door across from the Quincy Room, leading to the parking lot and I had to push on the bar 3 times before it opened.  I don't know if this is a once in a while issue, weather related, or other.  I have no physical handicap; however, I could see how this could be a problem for some individuals.  The bar doors should work as designed and not require 2 and 3 shoves.  Perhaps all the doors should be tested."|""|"Barbara Graham for another resident - Next Time I will redirect a requestor to this great form"|

I hope to maintain my anonymity to avoid any potential conflicts with my neighbors, but I feel it is crucial to address the matter of unleashed dogs within our neighborhood, specifically in the vicinity of Stockbridge Park.  It has come to my attention that some individuals in our community are allowing their dogs to roam freely without a leash in public areas, including Stockbridge Park. This issue is not only a violation of our HOA rules but also a direct contravention of Manteca city regulations, which require all dogs to be on a leash at all times in public spaces.  I have noticed that our security personnel have witnessed these dogs off-leash, yet they have not taken any action to enforce the rules. This lack of enforcement has emboldened those community members to continue disregarding the leash requirements, posing a danger to both humans and other dogs. I fear that if nothing is done, it is only a matter of time before a serious incident occurs.  As a responsible dog owner, I am deeply concerned about the safety of my dog and other residents who enjoy the park. If any of these off-leash dogs were to harm my pet, I would have no choice but to take legal action against both the Dell Webb community and the individuals violating these rules.  I kindly request that the HOA Board takes immediate and decisive action to address this issue. It is crucial to protect the safety and well-being of all residents, their pets, and visitors in our community. I understand that maintaining a harmonious living environment is a shared responsibility, and I trust that the board will take appropriate measures to ensure that all residents adhere to the rules and regulations that have been established for the benefit of everyone.  I appreciate your attention to this matter and hope for a prompt resolution. Thank you for your commitment to making our community a safe and enjoyable place for all.  Sincerely,  A Concerned Resident of the Dell Webb Community"|""|"Anonymous Resident"|
