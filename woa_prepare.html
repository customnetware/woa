                        Being prepared for an emergency isn't just about staying safe during a storm or a disaster. It's also about how to stay comfortable, clean, fed, and healthy afterwards—when a storm or disaster may have knocked out electricity.  Remember that your kit will depend on your own needs. Once you take a look at the basic items, consider what unique needs your family might have, such as supplies for pets or seniors. Use the list below to get started:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Non-perishable food (such as dried fruit, peanut butter, or energy bars)</li>
                            <li>First aid kit</li>
                            <li>Cash</li>
                            <li>Prescription medicines</li>
                            <li>Extra batteries or an alternative power source</li>

                            <li>Whistle to signal for help</li>

                        Make a plan today. Your family may not be together if a disaster strikes, so it is important to know which types of disasters could affect your area. Know how you’ll contact one another and reconnect if separated. Establish a family meeting place that’s familiar and easy to find.
                        <ul>
                            <li>How will I receive emergency alerts and warnings?</li>
                            <li>What is my shelter plan?</li>
                            <li>What is my evacuation route?</li>
                            <li>What is my family/household communication plan?</li>
                            <li>Do I need to update my emergency preparedness kit?</li>
                        </ul>
                        As you prepare your plan tailor your plans and supplies to your specific daily living needs and responsibilities. Discuss your needs and responsibilities and how people in the network can assist each other with communication, care of children, business, pets or specific needs like operating medical equipment. Create your own personal network for specific areas where you need assistance. Keep in mind some these factors when developing your plan:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Different ages of members within your household</li>
                            <li>Responsibilities for assisting others</li>
                            <li>Locations frequented</li>
                            <li>Dietary needs</li>
                            <li>Medical needs including prescriptions and equipment</li>
                            <li>Disabilities or access and functional needs including devices and equipment</li>
                            <li>Languages spoken</li>
                            <li>Cultural and religious considerations</li>
                            <li>Pets or service animals</li>
                            <li>Households with school-aged children</li>
                        </ul>
